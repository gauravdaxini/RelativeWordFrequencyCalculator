### Algorithm

We will be using 2 pair of Mapper and Reducer

RFCMapper1:
	-	Each line is split using the RegEx with blank space and then trimmed.
	-	Two Adjacent words are taken iteratively and set as keys with default value 1.

NWReducer:
	-	Combiner is used to group the keys

RFCReducer1:
	-	Relative frequency for each word is calculated and written in context.

This result is not in decending order of relative frequency, so another pair of Mapper and Reducer is used. tempOutput of RFCReducer1 is sent as input to RFCMapper2.

RFCMapper2:
	-	Key and values of previous stage are interchanged so that TempComarator class can sort the relative frequency in descending order.

RFCReducer2:
	-	This will filter out the result with Relative Frequency 1.0 and also lists out only top 100 results.
